# OEG Reporter

The OEG Reporter reports data from Tasking Manager (TM) to OpenStreetMap (OSM) following the standards defined by [Organized Editing Guidelines](https://wiki.osmfoundation.org/wiki/Organised_Editing_Guidelines) (OEG). It outputs the information required by the OEG to git repository and the OSM wiki. Below is a very simple representation of how this is implemented
